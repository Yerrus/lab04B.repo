    <h3>BIO</h3>
    <p>
        Meredith hopes to quickly graduate so he can reduce some of the financial stress on his parents. Although they are able to pay for his tuition, he seeks to do all he can to off-set some of the financial burden. Unfortunately, he little idea on where to start, and little time to spare.<br/>
        He also hopes getting into co-op can solve these issues.
