        As an international student, is unable to apply for student loans
        Works 30 hours at a sushi restaurant part time to pay off tuition and other living costs
        Always on social media, following pages and people who post cheap methods of living and eateries around town.
        Currently resides in a one room apartment, too expensive for his budget.
        Heavily loaded program, is out on campus all day.
        Takes public transit to school from Metrotown.
        If he fails to graduate this year, he is certain that he will be out of money to pay for his educations next semester.
